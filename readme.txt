Merged the calendar into the index file to make interactions easier.

can click on day on calendar and then hit specify date button to bring up markers only from that date.
Interaction with everything else is poor placing marker will bring up all other crime markers
regardless of date in that area. 

still need to make organizer print out list of crimes.
